In August of last year, clips of a group publicly feasting on beef in Dharan, a city in eastern Nepal, gathered much national outrage, as eating bovine meat is largely taboo in the country and oxen slaughter remains illegal. \n\nThis rabble-rousing tactic of activists, who were opposed to this law, triggered swift street mobilization by several Hindu groups in protest, who linked this incident to an already existing controversy in the city involving the setting up of a church opposite a Hindu temple. However, the potentially violent confrontation was foiled after the local administration temporarily restrained the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 movement. \n\nDharan remained on edge for weeks, with its diverse political and social landscape suddenly recast as a religious battlefield.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xf0\x9f\x9b\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\xac\x87\xef\xb8\x8f\xca\x80\xe1\xb4\x87\xe1\xb4\x80\xe1\xb4\x85 \xe1\xb4\x8d\xe1\xb4\x8f\xca\x80\xe1\xb4\x87\xe2\xac\x87\xef\xb8\x8f\xf0\x9f\x9b\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f",0,0,1,0,Tue Jun 18 15:34:44 +0000 2024,1,False,True
