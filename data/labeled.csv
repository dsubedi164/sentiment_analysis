In August of last year, clips of a group publicly feasting on beef in Dharan, a city in eastern Nepal, gathered much national outrage, as eating bovine meat is largely taboo in the country and oxen slaughter remains illegal. \n\nThis rabble-rousing tactic of activists, who were opposed to this law, triggered swift street mobilization by several Hindu groups in protest, who linked this incident to an already existing controversy in the city involving the setting up of a church opposite a Hindu temple. However, the potentially violent confrontation was foiled after the local administration temporarily restrained the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 movement. \n\nDharan remained on edge for weeks, with its diverse political and social landscape suddenly recast as a religious battlefield.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xf0\x9f\x9b\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\xac\x87\xef\xb8\x8f\xca\x80\xe1\xb4\x87\xe1\xb4\x80\xe1\xb4\x85 \xe1\xb4\x8d\xe1\xb4\x8f\xca\x80\xe1\xb4\x87\xe2\xac\x87\xef\xb8\x8f\xf0\x9f\x9b\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f",xf0x9fx97xa3xefxb8x8f xf0x9dx90x84xf0x9dx90x83xf0x9dx90x88xf0x9dx90x93xf0x9dx90x8exf0x9dx90x91xf0x9dx90x88xf0x9dx90x80xf0x9dx90x8b xf0x9dx90x8exf0x9dx90x85 xf0x9dx90x93xf0x9dx90x87xf0x9dx90x84 xf0x9dx90x8dxf0x9dx90x8exf0x9dx90x96 xe2x9cx8dxefxb8x8fnfrom nnnepalxe2x80x99 hindutva momentnbi shubhanga pandeynxe2x80x9ca littl decad nepal declar secular republ religi ident threaten emerg new axi polar polit former hindu kingdom nna string incid transpir past year rude awaken mani nepal xe2x80x94 includ complac public sphere xe2x80x94 inroad made activist network milit hindu nationalist particularli town close nepalxe2x80x99 long border india august last year clip group publicli feast beef dharan citi eastern nepal gather much nation outrag eat bovin meat larg taboo countri oxen slaughter remain illeg nnthi rabbler tactic activist oppos law trigger swift street mobil sever hindu group protest link incid alreadi exist controversi citi involv set church opposit hindu templ howev potenti violent confront foil local administr temporarili restrain protestersxe2x80x99 movement nndharan remain edg week divers polit social landscap suddenli recast religi battlefieldxe2x80x9dnxf0x9fx9bxa0xefxb8x8fxe2xacx87xefxb8x8fxcax80xe1xb4x87xe1xb4x80xe1xb4x85 xe1xb4x8dxe1xb4x8fxcax80xe1xb4x87xe2xacx87xefxb8x8fxf0x9fx9bxa0xefxb8x8f,negative
